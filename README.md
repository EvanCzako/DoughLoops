---BACKGROUND---

DoughLoops will be a simple step-sequencer that allows users to make drum beats. They will have the ability to click on a grid to add or remove sounds that will be triggered at the appropriate time when users press the “Play” button. The pattern will be played on an infinite loop until users press the “Stop” button. Users will have the ability to adjust the volume of the different drum sounds, the tempo of the loop, the length of the loop, and the subdivisions of each beat. I currently intend to use Canvas and Web Audio API, though I need a better understanding of both before I can confirm that they are the best options for this application.
